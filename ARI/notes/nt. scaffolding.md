# Notes on scaffolding as a teaching practice_

## 20181023

Definition of tutoring- "the means whereby an adult or expert helps somebody who is less adult or less expert." They develop skills genrally, but tasks are more specific (building blocks).

"The acquisition of skill in the human child can be fruitfully conceived as a hierarchical program in which component skills are combined into higher skills by appropriate orchestration to meet new, more complex task requirements" basic, already naturally gained skills meeting newer and more complex skills by having levels of slightly harder concepts to overcome until highest level is reached.

Definition of scaffolding: “This scaffolding consists essentially of the adult controlling those elements of the task that are initially beyond the learner’s capacity, thus permitting him to concentrate upon and complete only those elements that are within his range of competence.”

“comprehension of the solution must precede production” learner needs to be able to see a solution before he can make decisions on how to get the solution

Preliminary behavior: “children do in fact gain a sense of possible outcomes as well as of means for achieving outcomes” children gain a sense on how a solution is solved and the result  they should get (solving a math problem, getting a negative number, and thinking that something isn’t right and they shouldn’t be getting a negative)

“search of the structure of the problem often requires the support of the tutor, and may indeed be directly attributable to the tutor’s role “ backing off during preliminary behavior and intervening only when learner cannot do the structure of the problem.

Structure: gaining deeper understanding of the problem, checking facts (can you really do this), thinking if what they did “makes sense”, what are the barriers, and are they really barriers? Making connections(if I solve this barrier all the other barriers will be solved too) seeing the steps or path to the solution(I need to gather all the edge pieces of a puzzle in order to create a boarder so I can start seeing the picture, then add pieces that match the picture, and that’s how I am going to get a completed puzzle.)

Rules for the task: “it had to be both entertaining and challenging to the child while also proving sufficiently complex to ensure that his behavior over time could develop and change.” The structure needs to be repetitive so it can be applied in the future. It allowed the student to benefit from realizing what skill they learned previously was and how/when it applies, but you don’t want to make it too hard to the point where intrinsic value is lost
Tutor needs to be able to focus on specific child needs but also comparing each child to the procedure

Scaffolding process: recruitment, reduction in degrees of freedom, direction maintenance, marking critical features, frustration control, demonstration: attempt to allow learner to see discrepancies
