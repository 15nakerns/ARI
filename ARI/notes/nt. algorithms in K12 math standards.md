## Content Standards

We need to know the lingo for the hierarchy and time-development of math learning

"Standards" refers both to the single statements of "what a student should know" and to the entire, hierarchical set of learning progressions.

### Learning progressions

All math content is seen as following 4 main progressions that extend from K through 12th grade. These seem not to be named, but are largely the development of numbers, of operations, of geometry, and of data analysis.

#### K-8. Content as domains—clusters—standards

In K-8, the learning progressions track student's development through a three-tiered hierarchy. The content of mathematics learning is organized into 12 discrete areas of mathematics, several big ideas within each area, and specific competencies that flesh out each big idea. These are called "domains", "clusters", and "content standards" respectively. The table of "standards" for each grade organizes the content standards into clusters, and the clusters into the 12 domains, but gives no information on when or how the teacher is to get the students to meet the grade-level standards.

For example, the content standard identified as `3.MD.A.1` describes how students should work with time. It is the 1st standard in cluster A of domain MD in 3rd grade. Some or all students may know this content when they enter 3rd grade, or they may be learning it in a science class, but it is the teacher's responsibility to make sure each child can meet this standard by the time they move to 4th grade. When and how is not addressed.

#### 9-12. Domains fall under conceptual categories

In 9th grade, curricula branch out and become built around "courses", and students are typically guided to take courses based on their academic background, aptitudes, and ambitions. The courses become how the learning progression is delivered and they are responsible for targeting the content for the type of student that takes the course. However, the courses are not assigned to a specific grade level.

Perhaps due to the complexity of mathematical work given to students in these yeas, an additional layer is added to the content hierarchy to describe the learning for high school. At this point, the many domains of high school math content are subsumed under 5 "conceptual categories". These conceptual categories carry forth the 4 learning progressions from K-8.

For example, the content standard `M1.A.SSA.A.1` is about finding meaning in algebraic expressions. It is the 1st standard in cluster A in the domain SSE of the conceptual category A as addressed in the course M1. As in the earlier standards, how or when to get a student to meet this standard is not described.

#### Summary

In summary, until 9th grade, domains are tracked within the learning progressions. Each domain presents a few big ideas that are operationalized into specific content standards. After that, domains are subsumed under conceptual categories which are tracked in the learning progressions. The specific content under each category is delineated as domains, clusters, and content standards within courses. Therefore, the content mastery expected of students will differ depending upon the courses they take, but they are expected to develop in each of conceptual categories taken on by high school education.

## Standards for mathematical practice (MP)

> To develop the processes and proficiencies addressed in the practice standards, students must be engaged in rich, high-level mathematical tasks... [These] demand a greater level of cognitive effort to solve than routine practice problems...

Process
: A particular course of action intended to achieve a result... pertains to problem solving, reasoning and proof, communication, representation, and connections.

Proficiency (noun)
: [A skill] in the command of fundamentals... such as adaptive reasoning, strategic competence, conceptual understanding, procedural fluency, [and having] productive dispositions toward the work at hand.

Others pertinent to algorithmic thinking: "Make sense of problems and persevere in solving them (MP1)" and "Construct viable arguments and critique the reasoning of others (MP3)" and "Use appropriate tools strategically (MP5)"

    MP8. Look for and express regularity in repeated reasoning

    Do we want to look for instances of demonstrating competence in practice
    standards in the work?


### Literacy skills

Close readings, practice technical vocabulary, appropriate writing and use of symbols.

## Strategies vs algorithms

### First grade

1st grade standards use "strategies". K does not. Both use represent. For example

**1.OA.C.5** Add and subtract within 20 using strategies such as counting on, counting back, making 10...

**1.OA.C.6** Fluently add and subtract within 20 using mental strategies....

**1.NBT.C.4** ...Use concrete models, drawings, strategies based on place value,... to explain the reasoning used.

**1.NBT.C.6** Subtract multiples of 10 from multiples of 10... using concrete models, drawings, strategies based on place value, properties of operations...

### Second grade

In grade two, "strategies" appears in the descriptions of domains: "Students should solve a variety of problem types in order to make connections among contexts, equations, and strategies." (Operations and Algebraic Thinking), and "They should be able to explain why these strategies work" (Numbers and Operations in Base Ten), though it isn't clear to me what strategies they are referring to, perhaps "add and subtract within 1,000" or "add up to four two-digit numbers"

**2.NBT.B.5** "Fluently add and subtract within 100... using strategies based on place value..."

**2.NBT.B.6** "Add up to four two-digit numbers using properties of operations and strategies based on place value"

**2.NBT.B.7** "Add and subtract within 1000 using concrete models, drawings, strategies based on place value, ..."

**2.NBT.B.9** "Explain why addition and subtraction strategies work using properties of operations and place value..."

    It seems the "strategies" word appears around place value
