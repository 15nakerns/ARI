Title:	Exploration of meta-model conversations with children.

Subtitle:	Child engagement protocol
Version:	2 / 2103 Apr 1. Focus on nighttime sky
Author:	Michael Garrett

## Overview

This protocol is for an adult "experimenter" (X) working with one child (C) between 2nd grade and 8th grade (roughly, 7 yo to 13 yo). 

(Overall time, about 30 minutes)

*Purpose*

*Structure*

The protocol has a beginning and a wrap-up, and three core phases: 

1.	*Eliciting the initial child representation (ICR)*
	During the representation phase, the adult offers as little guidance and input as possible. His purpose is to affirm a positive engagement with the child, to establish joint attention to the task, and to get a reasonably finished concrete externalization of the child’s mind around the prompting question.

2.	*Engaging in a metamodel conversation (MMC)*
	During the conversation phase, the adult engages the child in a conversation focusing on aspects of her representation. His purpose is to guide the child to revisit the model, focusing on questions of internal consistency or fit with experience.

3.	*Looking for indications of deep understanding (IDU)*
	During the indications phase, the adult presents high-level task that require the child to use the model to explain something that can be experienced or to draw consequences of the model. His purpose is to explore how the child uses the model to understand the world.

### Setup

 The setup should be a quiet, well-lit setting, removed from possible informing aids (other representations of the solar system), with two chairs and a flat table sufficient for the child and the adult to lay out several sheets of standard paper to draw on. The adult should bring bring several pencils and white, letter-sized paper.

## Beginning the engagement

(time allowed, about 2 minutes)

**Goals:**	a) To quickly introduce myself and my purpose to the student; b) To lend him or her some sense of control over the process of the engagement and to take some agency away from the experimenter; c) To give some evidence about the disposition of the student toward science and the engagement; d) To insure that students uncomfortable with the situation have an exit from the engagement.

* Dialogic style: Do not fall into sing-song or affected interest. Affirm a positive engagement with the student, establish joint attention to the task. Show an honest interest in what the student thinks. Be careful not to introduce terms that falsely show you are interested in what they *know* or *have learned* and so on.

### Procedure

**Begin protocol**

X: Introduces himself. "Hello, [student's name]. I am Mr Garrett. I am trying to learn how to help teachers talk about science. Do you like science?"

C: Responds.

X: Prompts. "Well, could you work with me a while to talk about science?"

C: Responds. If child is upset or very uncomfortable, end session.

**End Introduction**

## Initial Representation Phase

(time allowed, 10 minutes)

**Goals:** a) To get a reasonably finished concrete externalization of the child’s understanding of the content term ("The Solar System"); b) To allow students who do not have available knowledge of the content (solar system) to have an exit from the engagement. 

* Dialogic style: Offer as little guidance and input as possible. Affirm a positive engagement with the child, establish joint attention to the task, and facilitate a child’s dialog with her own representation. 

### Procedure

**Test for inclusion criteria and establish natural conversation**

X: Prompts, “I am interested in the solar system, in how you think about the solar system.” [No external endpoint suggested]. “Do you know about the solar system?”

C: Responds. If affirmative, continue. If negative, probe further, (“Have you talked about the solar system in class?”, etc.). If the child does not respond positively to these probes, end session.

X: “Tell me about it. What is the solar system?”

C: Responds.

X: ‘Rogerian’ mirroring. Continue 1 minute.

**Elicit first draft of model**

X: Prompts, “Interesting. Tell you what, would you draw me your picture of the solar system? I have a pencil and some paper. How’s that?”

X: Allowed to encourage child, reaffirm request, and emphasize that he is interested in the child’s thinking, what’s in her head about the solar system. If child does not wish to draw after prompting, end session.

C: Draws, talks, asks questions.

	X: Responds with interest and engagement but
	
	*	gives no information about correctness, completeness, or quality of the drawing. 
	*	When asked specific questions, turns process back to child’s work at representing her mind (“Just put it where you think it is”, “That’s interesting,” “Well, I have my idea, but I’m interested in how you think about it.”) 
	*	Responds without content cues and information. For example, C: “This is Mars. It’s a planet I think. Is that what it is, a planet?” X: “Is that what you call it? Go ahead, put it down so we’ll know.”)
	
	C: Indicates she is finished, either verbally or with gestures (Putting pencil down, consistently distracted).

X: Prompts, “Are you finished?” 

C: Responds. 
*	If child answers affirmative, X prompts, “Is that everything you wanted to put down about the solar system?” If child answers affirmative again, X prompts, “Great! Let me take a look at it.” 
*	If child answers negative to either: “Alright.  Keep going. I want to see what you think about the solar system.”
	
**Elicit final draft of model**
 
X: Prompts, “Let me see.” Establishes joint attention to drawing.
 
X: Comments, “This is great. Very interesting. I am so curious about it, but I want to take a picture now. Hold on a second.“ Takes picture.

X: Prompts, “I need you to explain some things to me.” Asks child, “What is this”-questions about child’s drawing. 

C: Responds. If C asks specific reinforcement questions (“Is that right? Is that what it’s called”) X defers as above (“Well, if that’s what you call it, let’s just write it down. We’ll see later.”)

C: Answers questions, adds to drawing as she wishes, labels parts when she has specific language for them.

C: Indicates she is finished.

X: Prompts, “Great. Is that it? Do we have your drawing of the solar system?” If child answers affirmative, end initial representation phase. If child answers negative, X responds, “Alright, do you want to add something?” C adds to picture as she wishes.

X: Comments, “Great. You know, we’ve added a good bit. Let me take a picture again.”

## Metamodel Conversation Phase

(time allowed 10 minutes)

*Goal:* To have a substantive conversation with the child about her model by inviting her to consider, explain, modify, annotate, or draw on the draft drawing.

* Dialogic style:	Employ one or more strategies to engage the child with her own representation: a) use the representation to explain something; b) compare the representation to the actual world;  or c) make a focused refinement of the representation.

### Procedure

**Direct child's attention to questions about motion within the solar system**

X:	Prompts, "How about this? Do the parts of the solar system move?"

C:	Responds.

X:	Prompts, "How do they move? Can you show me something about that?"

C:	Responds.

X:	Prompts, "Very interesting. That makes me think, does Earth ever get closer to the Sun?"

C:	Responds.

X:	Prompts, "How does that feel on Earth?"

C:	Responds.

X:	Prompts, "Does the Earth or Sun move at all during a single day?" (ver 2)

C:	Responds.

	X:	Engages child in conversation showing interest and affirmation. Is free to ask clarifying questions ("How does that work?", "I don't get it. Can you tell me differently?") and redirects child to use her model. X does not offer new information or terms, but is free to use the child's lexicon as indicated on her drawing or in her conversation.
	C:	Responds.

**End Conversation Phase**

## Indications of Deep Understanding Phase

(time allowed 10 minutes)

*Goal:* To gauge the level of understanding the child has about the solar system and to see how she uses the model to explain real phenomenon.

* Dialogic style:	Offer as little guidance and input as possible. Affirm a positive engagement with the child, establish joint attention to the task, and facilitate a child’s use of her own representation.

### Procedure


**Task 1: Illustrate how the sun illuminates Earth** (Ver 2)

X:	Prompts, "Thinking about day and night, now I'm wondering, can you show me something about how that works?"

C: Responds.

	X:	Engages child in conversation showing interest and affirmation. Is free to ask clarifying questions ("How does that work?", "I don't get it. Can you tell me differently?") and redirects child to use her model. X does not offer new information or terms, but is free to use the child's lexicon as indicated on her drawing or in her conversation.
	C:	Responds. 

**Task 2: Explain the appearance of the night sky**

X:	Prompts, "I want to ask you a question. What are some things you see in the night sky?"

C:	Responds. If C offers no names, X rephrases question ("Think about it. When you look up in the sky at night, what kind of things do you see?"). If C offers no names, X offers suggestions ("Do you see the Moon?", etc.) If C identifies no items, skip.

	X:	Writes down items on new piece of paper. Asks child "Hmm, are these in the solar system?".

	C:	Responds. If affirmative or negative, continue. If "I don't know," etc., X prompts again, "Well, what do you think?", etc.

	X:	"Can you show me how that works on your ___?"

	C:	Responds. Child may draw on or amend their model. Child may use new paper to redraw. If child uses other tools to explain (hands, objects, etc.) X redirects her to use her model ("Nice. Now, show me on your ___.")

**Task 3: Explain why stars are not visible in the daytime sky**

X:	Prompts, "This all has got me to thinking about things, like, where are the stars during the day? What do you think?". X allows child time to respond. 

C:	Responds. If child begins to offer explanations, X directs her to "show me on your ___." If child offers "I don't know," etc., X prompts, "Think about it a second. Let's look at your drawing."

	X:	Engages child in conversation showing interest and affirmation. Is free to ask clarifying questions ("How does that work?", "I don't get it. Can you tell me differently?") and redirects child to use her model. X does not offer new information or terms, but is free to use the child's lexicon as indicated on her drawing or in her conversation.
	C:	Responds. 

**Task 4: Reconcile daily experience of Earth with the model**

X:	Prompts, "When you look outside the window, where is The Earth? [If window is available, invite child to look out and consider.]" "Where are the things we talked about in the nighttime sky? Where are they now?"

C:	Responds

	X:	Prompts, "Can you show me how that works on your ___?"

	C:	Responds. Child may draw on or amend their model. Child may use new paper to redraw. If child uses other tools to explain (hands, objects, etc.) X redirects her to use her model ("Nice. Show me on your ___.")

**End Indications Phase**

## Wrap-up

### Procedure

**Begin wrap-up**

X:	"Time's up for us. This has been very helpful. Thank you so much. Do you have any last questions you want to ask before you go back to class?"

C:	Responds. 

X: If child has questions, answers briefly. Says goodbye, "I've really enjoyed talking with you. This has been great. Thank you so much. We'll ask your teacher what you need to do next."

X:	Engages teacher to make a natural transition back to schooling.
